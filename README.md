# Coding Challenges

Run `yarn` at the top level to install the dependencies required for testing and source-to-source compilation.

Each coding challenge contains a set of tests in `implementation.test.ts`. The tests will run against methods exported from `implementation.js`, or `implementation.ts` if the first is not found.
